A grasshopper is a sweet, mint-flavored, after-dinner drink. The name of the drink derives from its green color,
which comes from crème de menthe. The drink reputedly originated at Tujague's, a landmark bar in the French Quarter of New Orleans,
Louisiana,[1] and was invented by its owner, Philip Guichet. The drink gained popularity during the 1950s and 1960s throughout the
American South.

A typical grasshopper cocktail consists of equal parts green crème de menthe, white crème de cacao, and cream—shaken with ice and
strained into a chilled cocktail glass.
